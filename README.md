# Glow-Cloud
An Arduino routine that shifts an LED light strip through a complex series of colors that varies based on the time of day.


This program is a component of the "Glow Cloud": a cloud-shaped lamp that contains an LED light strip that
gradually shifts colors throughout the day. It acts as a light clock, and provides a gentle, passive
and visually attractive reminder of the time. At set times throughout the day, it transitions
between various modes: "sunrise", "day", "sunset", and "night". Each mode has a set of colors that
the cloud displays in random patterns.


Here is a short video that demonstrates how it works:
